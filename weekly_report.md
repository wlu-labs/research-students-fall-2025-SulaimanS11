## Weekly Report
- This file contains a paragraph of 1000 Characters or more about the progress made by the student for each week. I am creating the place holder for it.

### Week 1 (Date: Sept 8 - 12   )
This week, my primary focus was on foundational research and project scoping. Following a meeting with the Digital Twin team on Wednesday, I chose the project I will be working on for the duration of this research study: enhancing the scalability of the DTUMOS platform through multi-threaded programming. This project aims to address the limitations of the current DTUMOS architecture by investigating and implementing multiprocessing or compiled extensions to improve the performance and scalability of CPU-bound simulations. To build a strong knowledge base for this work, I conducted my literature review. I analyzed three key papers. The first, "DTUMOS, digital twin for large-scale urban mobility operating system," served as a direct reference, detailing the current architecture and scalability challenges I will be addressing. The second paper, "The path to medical superintelligence" by Microsoft AI, though in a different domain, provided insight into benchmarking large-scale AI systems, which will inform how I measure the performance gains of my solution. The third paper, "TransETA: transformer networks for estimated time of arrival with local congestion representation," was crucial for understanding deep learning models for complex traffic simulations and highlighted the importance of computational efficiency. In a subsequent meeting, Mr. Sehra directed me to focus my initial research on core concepts like parallel processing, Python programming for multi-threaded applications, and thread-level processing. These topics will form the basis of my next steps as I transition from research to practical implementation. My work this week has successfully established a clear project direction and a strong theoretical foundation.

### Week 2 (Date: Sept 15 - 19  )
This week, I continued my foundational research, with a specific focus on the core technical concepts that will underpin my project. I conducted review and research on parallel processing and multi-threaded programming, delving into how these techniques can be applied to enhance the performance of CPU-bound simulations. I also expanded my literature review to include research on optimizing DTUMOS, with attention to Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) models. My research this week has been crucial for building a strong theoretical framework before I transition to practical implementation and codebase analysis. The knowledge I've gained will directly inform my approach to optimizing DTUMOS for improved scalability.

### Week 3 (Date: Sept 22 - 26  )
This week, I shifted my focus from a broad literature review to a more practical analysis of the project. My primary accomplishment was completing a thorough review of the DTUMOS codebase. This deep dive was critical for identifying potential areas for optimization and understanding the existing architecture's limitations. Concurrently, I continued to refine my research into optimization strategies, multi-threaded programming, and parallel processing. This dual-pronged approach of hands-on code analysis and theoretical research has provided me with a clear roadmap for the next phase of my project, allowing me to pinpoint specific sections of the code that can benefit from performance enhancements. My work this week has successfully bridged the gap between foundational knowledge and practical application.
