## Weekly Report
- This file contains a paragraph of 1000 Characters or more about the progress made by the student for each week. I am creating the place holder for it.

### Week 1 (Date: Sept 8 - 12   )
This week, my primary focus was on foundational research and project scoping. Following a meeting with the Digital Twin team on Wednesday, I chose the project I will be working on for the duration of this research study: enhancing the scalability of the DTUMOS platform through multi-threaded programming. This project aims to address the limitations of the current DTUMOS architecture by investigating and implementing multiprocessing or compiled extensions to improve the performance and scalability of CPU-bound simulations. To build a strong knowledge base for this work, I conducted my literature review. I analyzed three key papers. The first, "DTUMOS, digital twin for large-scale urban mobility operating system," served as a direct reference, detailing the current architecture and scalability challenges I will be addressing. The second paper, "The path to medical superintelligence" by Microsoft AI, though in a different domain, provided insight into benchmarking large-scale AI systems, which will inform how I measure the performance gains of my solution. The third paper, "TransETA: transformer networks for estimated time of arrival with local congestion representation," was crucial for understanding deep learning models for complex traffic simulations and highlighted the importance of computational efficiency. In a subsequent meeting, Mr. Sehra directed me to focus my initial research on core concepts like parallel processing, Python programming for multi-threaded applications, and thread-level processing. These topics will form the basis of my next steps as I transition from research to practical implementation. My work this week has successfully established a clear project direction and a strong theoretical foundation.
